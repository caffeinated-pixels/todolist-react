# Responsive ToDo App

Based on [Dave Gray's excellent YT tutorial](https://youtu.be/y51Cv4wnsPw), this is a mobile first todo app with a strong focus on accessibilty.

After completing the tutorial, I figured it would be a useful learning experience to rebuild the app with React and restyle to my own tastes.

## ToDo list:

- clear list
- clear checked item
- put list into localstorage API
- pull list from localstorage API
- customise styling

## Stretch features

- leave check items on list; add remove button to each
- ability to reorder items?
