# Responsive ToDo App

Based on [Dave Gray's excellent YT tutorial](https://youtu.be/y51Cv4wnsPw), this is a mobile first todo app with a strong focus on accessibilty and being screen-reader friendly.

After completing the tutorial, I figured it would be a useful learning exercise to rebuild the app with React (the tutorial uses HTML, SASS and vanilla JS) and then customise the styling and expand the functionality.

The app is still fairly simple, so perhaps in the future I may return to add some additional functionality, such as:

- multiple list support
- ability to reorder items
- delete btn only appearing on item focus

You can [see the app in action](#) here.

## Notes

### FontAwesomeIcon click handler

Seems that you can't pass an event into a click handler for a `<FontAwesomeIcon />` component, even if you place the click handler in a wrapper. However, we can pass in our own parameter using an anonymous function.
